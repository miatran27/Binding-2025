                <h1>Colors Matter</h1>
                <p>This website brings together three short readings that explore how color shapes the way we see and experience the world. Color plays a major role in perception, helping us recognize objects, navigate spaces, and respond emotionally to what we see. In marketing and design, color is a powerful tool for communication, branding, and influence. At the same time, every color holds layered meaning: cultural associations that exist collectively, and personal interpretations shaped by individual experience. Because of this, the way we understand color is never completely universal. When color interacts with light, gradients emerge, creating smooth transitions that reflect the fluid nature of perception itself. Together, these articles look at how we use color, how we perceive it, and how it affects the way we feel in both subtle and impactful ways.</p>
