# Binding-2025

Overall, this project was quite fun, but I did stump into some issues with things being overide just because there are a lot of pages and making sure I'm dividing things the reight way between the style sheet for individual pages, and the common.css page. 

I tried to design of the things in common.css then added specific styles to the individual style sheets, and that helped!

Learning from project 1 and 2, I wanted to make sure my code follows the C.R.Y format, so making sure the code is as clean as I can. I think as a next stem, I want to implement animation into the website more, using columns and grids more to make my web page looks more interesting. But overall, I learned a lot!
